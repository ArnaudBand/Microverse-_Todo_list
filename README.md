<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [To-do_List] <a name="about-project"></a>

> Describe your project in 1 or 2 sentences.

**[To-do_list]** is a simple task management application that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. The project typically involves a user interface where tasks can be added and organized into categories or lists. The user can set deadlines or reminders for each task and mark them as complete when they are finished. The application may also include features like search, filtering, and sorting to make it easy for users to find specific tasks. The main goal of a to-do list project is to help users stay organized and manage their tasks effectively.
